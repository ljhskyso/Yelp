## Concept idea advertisement

A traditional to-do list is based on Time, i.e., when 10am alter me to do something. But nowadays, the world is much more complicated, moving much quicker, and more and more events are happening way faster than you would expect. The fact is that, it might have been out of your imagination.
How can you organize your life/work/events based on TIME any more? You need something new, something smart, something can understand your life:
	THIS IS LetMeKnow! !
LetMeKnow! is an event-driven notification-based platform. IF THIS THEN LetMeKnow!. You can simply set up what YOU want to know. For example, LetMeKnow! when any merchant has a deal that iPad can be bought at the price of $350; or, LetMeKnow! when Groupon’s stock price reach back to $50 or drop down to $1; or, LetMeKnow! when I am around any sort of Pharmacy and I want to buy a medicine.
Or, you can set up something much more complicated, which just like your life: LetMeKnow! when I am around a Pharmacy and the store happens to have a deal on my medicine; or, LetMeKnow! when [Chanel’s powder OR Dior’s lipstick OR any of SK-II has a deal more than 20% off] AND at the same time, my credit-card has available balance more than $1000 AND no future payment needed for at least 15 days. Something like that. This is like your real life, and LetMeKnow! understands your life.
Price checking is just one part of our intelligence, LetMeKnow! will Let You Know about a lot more, including Weather, News Trends, Public Transportation Schedule, Route Traffic, Movie Plans, etc.
So, what is your life, and what is your plan? LetMeKnow!!
